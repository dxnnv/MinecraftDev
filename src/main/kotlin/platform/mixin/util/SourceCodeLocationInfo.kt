/**
 * Info returned from the bytecode to help locate an element from the source code.
 *
 * For example, if searching for a lambda in the source code, this contains the index of the lambda in the method (i.e.
 * how many lambdas were before this one), the starting line number of the lambda (or `null` if there were no line
 * numbers), and the index of the lambda within this line number (i.e. how many lambdas there were before this one in
 * the same line).
 *
 * The line number stored is unmapped, and may need remapping via [remapLineNumber].
 * [createMatcher] does this internally.
